This guide covers the steps to install Terraform, configure AWS credentials from your AWS Academy account, and run basic Terraform commands to create AWS resources.

---

## 1. Install Terraform on macOS

### Using Homebrew (recommended)

1. Open your terminal.
2. Run the following commands to install Terraform:

   ```bash
   brew tap hashicorp/tap
   brew install hashicorp/tap/terraform
   ```

3. Verify the installation by typing "terraform -v" in terminal

4. Log in to your AWS Academy Learner Lab.
5. Locate your AWS credentials â€” you will need: (These are only valid for the duration of your lab. Redo everytime you log in)
   - ![alt text](image.png)
     (click on AWS details)
   - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
   - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
   - AWS_SESSION_TOKEN
   - AWS_DEFAULT_REGION (us-ease-1 for all of us)
6. Export these variables in your terminal session:

   - export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key-id"
   - export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-access-key"
   - export AWS_SESSION_TOKEN="your-session-token"
   - export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="ap-southeast-2"
   - Note: These environment variables last only for the current terminal session. Export them each time you open a new terminal or automate with a script.

7. Do:
   - terraform init
   - terraform plan
   - terraform apply
